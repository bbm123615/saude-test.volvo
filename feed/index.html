										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he had spoken to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Tuesday and the pair discussed their “intention to have a constructive relationship.”</p>
<p>“The UK will continue to engage with China where it furthers our interests,” Cameron said in a post on X, adding that they had also discussed the situation in Israel and Gaza, and the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s appointment of former British leader Cameron as foreign minister last month caused concern among some lawmakers in his Conservative Party about what it would mean for the government’s approach to China.</p>
<p>As prime minister, Cameron heralded a “golden era” in relations with China in 2015, something Sunak has said is over.</p>
<p>Sunak has instead sought to balance national security interests with better cooperation on trade and climate change.</p>

<div id="body-text" class="box-wrapper">
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Even the most ardent Saudi Pro League supporter would likely feel Ronaldo’s suggestion is a little far-fetched. Still, a meteoric recent rise in popularity, stimulated by significant government investment and the arrival of some genuinely world-class players, means the Portuguese forward’s assertions deserve to be at least scrutinized.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">On Friday, Al Hilal beat local rival Al-Nassr 3-0 in an entertaining Riyadh derby viewed in many countries worldwide for the first time – thanks to a recent global proliferation of broadcast rights. Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra hopes this is just the beginning, but also struck a cautious tone around the ‘top five’ narrative.</p>

<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“The objectives that were set for us by the leadership of the country were to achieve a certain status for the league around the world,” Nohra told Al Arabiya English on the sidelines of the match in Riyadh.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“The support they’ve given us demonstrates their commitment, but from the outset, we were very clear that it’s going to take a while to get there,” he said.</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Parallels with China</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“We’ve heard this ‘top five’ before, but don’t look at a number. We simply want to be considered among the best leagues in the world. As long as we are doing what we set off to do, it should lead us towards the top of this ladder,” he added.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Parallels are often drawn between the Saudi Pro League’s recent rise and that of the Chinese Super League in the late 2000s. At that time, domestic football in China exploded as new clubs and owners splashed the cash on big European names. Oscar and Hulk swapped Chelsea and Zenit St Petersburg for Shanghai SIPG, while Paulinho and Jackson Martinez moved to Guangzhou Evergrande from Tottenham and FC Porto, respectively.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Big transfers and big salaries were the norm, with some rapid results. Led by legendary Italian manager Marcelo Lippi, Guangzhou Evergrande became the first Chinese club to win the AFC Champions League in 2013.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Two years later, with World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari at the helm, Guangzhou repeated the feat. China was tipped to bid for FIFA World Cup hosting rights, and all was rosy. Then, the bubble burst.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Chris Atkins, a FIFA football agent and former journalist who has worked extensively in China, recalls how things began to fall apart.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“I think the major difference currently between the two is obviously that Saudi investment is effectively direct government investment, whereas China was encouraging private enterprise to invest,” Atkins explained.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“The issue was that you attract attention once you are a high-profile entrepreneur in China. Many of those who invested in football have fallen foul with government investigations at some point,” he said. “At the time, there was an explosion in investment across sports and entertainment in China, but it was based on easy credit. Those financing club football began to fall away when that dried up.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Despite the differences in approach between Saudi Arabia and China, Atkins says that the potential disruption of football’s status quo is a topic that will always get people talking.</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Incredible Saudi resources</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“The fear amongst the European establishment certainly feels similar now to how it did back then,” Atkins said. “As does the increasing reliance of clubs on big transfer fees when trying to offload players to the region,” Atkins said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">He further explained: “The big difference, I think, is that Saudi Arabia seems more willing to let the cash flow before seeing returns. The country has incredible resources, but even then, you have to question how long even the richest nations in the world are willing to incur losses without seeing any tangible progress. China would never afford its clubs that long, but I guess Saudi Arabia might.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Saudi Pro League chief Nohra also feels that there are fundamental differences in the two countries’ football cultures. The former UAE Pro League CEO, who most recently worked as Vice President and General Manager at WWE Asia-Pacific, also outlined his desire for the Kingdom’s elite division to focus on forging its path.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“There is a great football culture here already,” Nohra stressed.</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">‘Distinctly different from China’</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“Eighty percent of the population of Saudi Arabia is involved in football in some shape or form, making it distinctly different from China. This is a real product. Football has existed in this country for a long time, the league has existed here for 50 years,” he told Al Arabiya English.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“But what is critically important to us is the support we have to deliver on our promise to Saudi Arabia’s leadership – and deliver sustainably. Of course, we’ll have to rectify and adjust as we go along to see what works and what doesn’t,” Nohra said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“We want to try new and innovative things – it’s not about cookie cutting and doing what others have done. Who knows how things will evolve? It’s a great opportunity for the Saudi Pro League to be leaders.”</p>

</div>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“She is terrified (when they happen),” he told Al Arabiya English, adding that the latest bout of cyclones had devasted their home. “Everything has been destroyed,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Ruben, who works in research, science and development, says climate change-linked events have become devastatingly frequent over the past decade.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“These tropical cyclones are some of the events that are becoming severe at the moment in the past 10-20 years,” he said. “We have experienced three severe tropical cyclones in just a span of eight months this year, so it’s something that confirms that our climate conditions now are totally different to what we have had in the past.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">A compounding issue, he said, is when cyclones happen so close in a short period, leaving islanders no chance to rebuild and recover.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">A host of calamities, including from rising sea levels to, cyclones, and droughts, to coral erosions, made worse by the climate crisis, are threatening the entire existence of island nations like Vanuatu, which is hoping some financial relief may be brought by the sorely-needed Loss and Damages (L&amp;D) fund to help world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries which have been operationalized this year in a landmark announcement on the first day of the COP28, with the host UAE pledging $100 million.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“Cyclones, rising sea-levels… the impacts are huge, just huge. So, it makes recovery very difficult compared to in the past,” said Ruben. “The impacts of extreme events impact communities differently.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“But since most of our population lives in rural areas, that means that most of our people have limited access to essential services. And when it comes to extreme events and sea level rise and all these climate related disasters strike, I would say that generally most of our populations are impacted. Very, very badly.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Ruben said he would like to see COP28 pave the way for not only financial relief but aid to help scientists and experts in the small island nation build a dedicated research center into how climate change is specifically impacting Vanuatu.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“If we can do our own research, it will really help to put real issues into our scientific reports to inform our decision-makers,” he explained. “Financial aid could also go into building equipped evacuation centers for when cyclones hit,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">For now, Ruben is focused on a world that is safe for his baby daughter, whom he was separated from during a cyclone earlier this year. Ruben lost contact with her for eight hours and said: “I didn’t know if she was even alive.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“It is getting worse,” he said, on climate change-induced disasters. “All my family is in Vanuatu. I can’t leave there. It is my home. And my story is a common story.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">And unlike Ruben, who has faced numerous natural disasters threatening his home and the lives of his loved ones, 23-year-old youth activist Johnny K. Silk, Jr., from the Marshall Islands, hopes to bring change before it is too late.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Speaking to Al Arabiya English, Silk said: “I am worried about losing my home and I feel like it’s unfair that I should be worried and that I should be trying to come up with solutions and, you know, making an adaptation plan. I feel like it’s unfair.”</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Smallest polluters at highest risk</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The sparsely populated, low-lying islands, despite being among the smaller polluters in the world, are among the first places at risk of being claimed by the ocean as sea levels rise owing to global warming. This is in addition to facing natural disasters like droughts, tropical storms, and cyclones.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">They are now faced with the decision to reclaim the seabed to reinforce their shores or risk being displaced in about 70 years, when some projections see the country going underwater.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“I feel like it’s really important for us to be here to share our message and our stories and to make sure that whatever is put in the text of the negotiation rooms is also equitable and it works for us as well,” Silk said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“What we want to do is encourage bigger emitters to phase out of fossil fuels. And we also want to display our resilience by launching the national adaptation plan and making sure that people know that we’re not just sitting back.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“Throughout the Marshall Islands, a common message that we hear, especially from the youth, is that we’re staying, even if it means we swim in our islands, in our homes.”</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Slow progress over data</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The scarcity of data and difficulty in translating it into working information that can be used to make informed decisions to support indigenous communities and women is one of the biggest challenges faced by COP28 host nation UAE’s UN Climate Change High-Level Champion Razan al-Mubarak.</p>

</div>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Speaking to Al Arabiya English at the site of the UN climate conference on Tuesday, al-Mubarak said that the data that is being collected on the ground is not being communicated, “not because of lack of data, but a lack of confidence in the data.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“There needs to be much more engagement between the various databases. And we do now have the technology to do so,” she told Al Arabiya English in response to a query during a media briefing.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Al-Mubarak is also the president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the founder of various national environmental and conservation agencies like the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund and the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency.</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Climate change amplifies gender inequalities</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The Emirati environment and wildlife veteran reiterated how the impact of climate change is not gender neutral and how it amplifies existing gender inequalities, “posing a serious threat to women’s livelihoods, health and wellbeing.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The topic of financing the response to climate change, a bedrock of the UAE’s COP28’s agenda, was highlighted as a necessity. “For action, we need finance. And finance needs to flow to those who are on the front line.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Al Arabiya English spoke to various indigenous climate activists who voiced concern over the allocated funds not reaching the designated individuals and organizations.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">When Al Arabiya English questioned the UAE official about the discrepancy in allocated funds, al-Mubarak said: “First of all, we have to acknowledge and recognize that it’s not reaching them and… work together on understanding what the bottlenecks are. And thirdly, ensure that indigenous peoples are on the table to design the financial vehicles to ensure that the financial flows get to them.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">On Monday, the COP28 Presidency announced a new commitment titled ‘COP28 Gender-Responsive Just Transitions &amp; Climate Action Partnership’ that will work towards actioning on data, finance, and equal opportunities, with implementation to be reviewed during COP31.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">As of Tuesday, 68 countries out of over 196 have signed up to the commitment.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“In 24 hours, if you are able to get more than 60 countries, I think the mentality is there because of this growing recognition and acknowledgment that you cannot reach a just energy transition while excluding women, excluding those that are on the front line,” al-Mubarak told Al Arabiya English.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Al-Mubarak also said she expects all the parties to get on board and sign the commitment. “We’re shooting for the stars.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The State Department said Monday that the US special envoy for Yemen is traveling to the Gulf amid Iranian and Houthi attacks on international shipping, which is threatening almost two years of joint progress to end the war in Yemen.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Tim Lenderking will also emphasize the need to contain the Israel-Hamas conflict, according to a readout of his planned trip.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The Iran-backed Houthis have lobbed missiles and other projectiles at Israel since the fighting began following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">This violence has also threatened the upend progress made on the yearslong war in Yemen, which has pitted the internationally recognized Yemeni government against the Houthi militia.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Lenderking will continue “intensive” US diplomacy and regional coordination to safeguard maritime security in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden as these Houthi and Iranian attacks increase, the State Department said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">US warships have come into close proximity to missiles and projectiles fired by Iran-backed groups in the Middle East, including the Houthi militants in Yemen.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">On Monday, a US defense official said the USS Carney destroyed one Houthi drone headed in their direction in the Red Sea. The Carney also saw at least one ballistic missile fired at a civilian commercial vessel and, while assisting the Unity Explorer, shot down another Houthi drone. That came one day after the US military intercepted an Iranian UAV near the Eisenhower aircraft carrier, which a US defense official said was conducting flight operations and made the UAV’s physical presence unsafe for any aircraft also in the immediate airspace.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The US military said it had every reason to believe Monday’s four attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea were “fully enabled” by Iran despite being launched by Yemen’s Houthis, adding that the US would consider “all appropriate responses.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“The Special Envoy will emphasize the need to contain the Israel-Hamas conflict while pursuing the United States’ priority of Yemeni-Yemeni political dialogue to end the war and set Yemen on a firm course for peace and stability,” the State Department said.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The statement went on to say, “A wider conflict in the Middle East does not serve US interests nor those of our regional partners, who support a lasting peace in Yemen.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Meanwhile, Washington is working with partners to secure safe passage for global shipping. They are also working with the UN, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman and others to support a resolution to the Yemen war as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">During his trip, Lenderking will meet with officials in the Gulf to look at necessary steps to secure a durable ceasefire and launch an inclusive, UN-led Yemeni-Yemeni political dialogue.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Yemen had been home to one of the worst humanitarian crises on the planet as a result of the war.</p>

After initially focusing its assault on the north of Gaza, the army has now sent ground forces into the south and dropped leaflets telling Palestinian civilians in more districts to evacuate.</p>
<p>Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen on Monday near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, which is packed with displaced civilians, witnesses told AFP.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said it was taking “aggressive” action against Hamas and other militants in Khan Younis, warning that the main road in the north and east of the city “constitutes a battlefield.”</p>
<p>Hamas claimed via Telegram its militants had targeted two personnel carriers and a tank near Khan Younis.</p>
<p>Its military branch also said it had fired rockets towards Beersheba in southern Israel on Tuesday, while the Israeli military said rocket warning sirens sounded there.</p>
<p>Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and which saw around 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli authorities.</p>
<p>In retaliation for the worst attack in its history, Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and secure the release of all the hostages held in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the war has killed nearly 15,900 people in the territory, around 70 percent of them women and children.</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">‘Nowhere safe’</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">
International aid organizations have warned that civilians in the densely populated Strip are running out of places to flee to.</p>
<p>“Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go,” said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>“If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,” Hastings said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ambulances, trucks and other vehicles delivered more bloodied, dust-covered casualties to Khan Younis’s Nasser hospital, including children.</p>
<p>After visiting another medical facility in the city, the European Hospital, International Committee of the Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric said she saw horrors that were hard to describe.</p>
<p>“What shocked me the most were the children with atrocious injuries and at the same time having lost their parents with no one looking after them,” she said in a video.</p>
<p>“We can’t turn away from what is evidently a moral failure in the face of the international community,” she added.</p>
<p>Their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and even camels, Gazans headed south to try to escape the expanding Israeli offensive.</p>
<p>An estimated 1.8 million people are displaced in Gaza &#8212; roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures.</p>
<p>An Israeli order for people to move from Khan Younis to the southern city of Rafah “created panic, fear and anxiety,” according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).</p>
<div class="teadsad1"></div>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said.</p>
<p>Even in Rafah, resident Abu Jahar al-Hajj said an air strike near his home felt “like an earthquake.”</p>
<p>“Pieces of concrete started falling on us,” he said.</p>
<p>Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting in the territory, the army said on Tuesday, raising the number of troop deaths there to 78.</p>
<p>The military denied telling the World Health Organization (WHO) to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours before ground operations in the area render it unusable.</p>
<p>WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier wrote on social media platform X that his organization had received a notification from the army “that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours.”</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Communications blackout</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">
Key ally the United States has cautioned Israel to do more to avert civilian casualties as operations shift to the south.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Israel on Monday said it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes, but that it was instead seeking support from aid groups to improve infrastructure in a tiny coastal area of Gaza named al-Mawasi.</p>
<p>“We have asked civilians to evacuate the battlefield and we have provided a designated humanitarian zone inside the Gaza Strip,” Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said.</p>
<p>As well as dropping leaflets, the army has been warning civilians in Gaza to leave certain areas ahead of impending strikes via messages to mobile phones.</p>
<p>But on Monday, all mobile and telephone services were cut across Gaza “due to the cut-off of main fiber routes from the Israeli side,” according to Palestinian telecommunications firm Paltel.</p>
<p>Global network monitor Netblocks confirmed Tuesday that Gaza residents were experiencing “a total loss of communications.”</p>
<p>The fighting follows the collapse on Friday of a Qatar-mediated truce that saw scores of Israeli and other hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>According to the Israeli military, at least 137 hostages are still being held in Gaza, but Hamas has ruled out more releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.</p>
<p>Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, denounced what he called “shameful” international inaction over the war as he opened a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting.</p>
<p>The war has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with frequent exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel’s border with Lebanon.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck Hezbollah positions in response to launches on Monday from Lebanon into Israel.</p>
<p>The Israel-occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence, with more than 250 Palestinians killed there since the war began, according to Palestinian authorities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qatar’s emir on Tuesday called on the UN Security Council to force Israel to return to the negotiating table over the war in Gaza, saying the inaction by the international community in halting the conflict was “shameful.”</p>
<p>“It is shameful for the international community to allow this heinous crime to continue for nearly two months, during which the systematic and deliberate killing of innocent civilians continues, including women and children,” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said in a speech to Gulf leaders gathered in the Qatari capital Doha for a regional summit.</p>
<p>Qatar, where several political leaders of Hamas are based, has been leading negotiations between the Palestinian militant group and Israel.</p>
<p>Those talks led to a truce that ultimately lasted for seven days before hostilities resumed on Friday. During the truce, Hamas released dozens of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and Israel allowed humanitarian aid to flow into the coastal strip.</p>
<p>Sheikh Tamim said Qatar was working with both sides to repair the deal.</p>
<p>He also said that temporary truces cannot be alternatives to a complete ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, adding that “tragedies could have been avoided if Israel had recognized the Palestinians’ right to a state.”</p>
<p>He added that Israel has violated humanitarian and moral standards in the strip and targeted fragile infrastructure and cut all vital supplies.</p>
<p>Reaffirming his rejection of targeting civilians from all nationalities, the emir said that the principle of self-defense does not permit Israel to “commit genocide crimes.”</p>
<p>Israel launched its assault to wipe out Hamas in retaliation for an October 7 cross-border attack when militants killed 1,200 people and seized 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>In eight weeks of warfare, the Gaza health ministry said at least 15,899 Palestinians, 70 percent of them women or under 18s, have been killed.</p>
<p>In November, the 15-member UN Security Council overcame an impasse and called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in fighting between Israel and Hamas for a “sufficient number of days” to allow aid access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">As activists across COP28 on Tuesday raised the pitch on Africa’s development of oil-and-gas resources, the landlocked East African nation of Uganda, which is developing what will be the world’s longest heated crude oil pipeline, announced its Energy Transition Plan, even as it reiterated that pumping oil was integral to its energy future.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">At a forum on Sunday, just a few meters away from the protesters’ chants of “don’t come to Africa,” aimed at dispelling the mega-corporations who are coming into the energy-rich nations of the continent to pump out oil, Ugandan ministers laid out decarbonization plans across the board.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">However, they said they believed the oil-and-gas sector could still coexist with its plans for renewable energy, and together could address the domestic and regional energy needs for its growing population, create tens of thousands of jobs and fund a switch to a mixed energy future, with more reliance on renewables.</p>

<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The multi-billion-dollar East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) – a collaboration between TotalEnergies EP Uganda (TotalEnergies), China National Offshore Oil Corporation Uganda Limited (CNOOC) and the Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) – is the keystone of further developing Uganda’s booming oil-and-gas sector that is scheduled to pump its first crude oil in 2025.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">But the pipeline, which has the potential to pump 240,000 barrels of oil a day, has drawn global criticism at a time when the world is shifting to a non-oil-reliant, decarbonized realm and a concerted call to action to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Despite this, the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry for Energy and Mineral Development, Uganda, Irene Bateebe, said the country had ambitious plans to decarbonize and, by 2065, become Net Zero while, at the same time, making sure none of its people “are left behind.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The forum heard how Uganda has set an ambitious Energy Transition Plan, endorsed and co-designed by the International Energy Agency, to develop its substantial energy and mineral resources, promote economic development, end energy poverty, and lead the country to a “just energy transition.”</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">One of the world’s least developed countries, Uganda’s stated objective in Vision 2040 is to transform into “a modern and prosperous country,” ensuring a better future for its citizens. The energy sector is expected to play an important role in helping Uganda achieve this.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Uganda is endowed with abundant natural resources, including fertile soils, petroleum deposits, and reserves of iron ore, phosphates, copper, cobalt, aluminum, and gold. The agricultural sector employs more than 80 percent of the country’s workforce, mostly in subsistence farming.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Uganda had a population of 47 million in 2022, around 25 percent of which was urban. The country’s fast population growth has undermined efforts to increase access to modern energy.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Its ambitious Energy Transition Plan aims to wean the 94 percent of the 45 million-strong population currently burning biomass (firewood and charcoal) for domestic use onto cheaper, cleaner electricity generated renewably without carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The plan protects the carbon sink forests of the East African nation and dramatically reduces the country’s current carbon emissions, which are driven largely by biomass consumption. If the current high demand for biomass continues unchecked, it is estimated that Uganda’s entire national stock of forest and tree cover will disappear within 20 years.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">While Uganda is already a leader in renewables, generating roughly 95 percent of its electricity from hydro and solar power, its current capacity is about 2GW, with only a limited distribution network focused mainly around the capital, Kampala.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The Energy Transition Plan has a twin strategy at its heart to drive both supply and demand: Increasing renewable generation supply to 52GW by 2040 and stimulating demand through a combination of improved distribution capacity and smart technology that will qualify an appliance like a domestic cooker for an e-tariff that makes it much cheaper to use than biomass.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">While such a plan will be unaffordable for most developing countries, Uganda plans to fund the Energy Transition Plan in part through revenues from its oil-and-gas reserves.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">It will, said the ministers, help the country achieve its ambitious energy goals.</p>
<h3 class="inline-title" data-aa-component="inlineTitle" data-allow-readmode="">Universal access to clean, reliable energy sources</h3>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Achieving universal access to clean and reliable energy sources for electricity and cooking remains a challenge in the country and is a high priority for the government in achieving economic and social development. With around 30 percent of the population having access to electricity and less than 6 percent having access to clean cooking fuels, Uganda continues to have one of the lowest electrification and clean cooking rates in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Although the share of people with access to clean cooking fuels has rapidly increased since 2010, the rapid population growth has led to an increase in the number of people without access to clean energy sources.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">In its National Energy Policy 2023, the Ugandan government aims to ensure universal access to electricity, modernize and diversify Uganda’s energy mix, promote efficient sector-wide use of energy, and secure affordable energy supply while offering access to clean cooking solutions to 50 percent of the population by 2040.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">“As a country, we continue to increase our energy access from current levels to achieve universal access,” said Bateebe, adding that Uganda is positioning itself as an energy hub in Africa, with the growing industry set to provide some 220,000 jobs by the end of the decade. “A clear roadmap is needed for a sustainable future,” Bateebe added.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">The aim is for electricity to become the fastest-growing fuel in the country by 2040 and reach Net Zero in the energy sector by 2065.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">However, the ministers said finance and investment were integral to this shift to renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="body-1 paragraph" data-aa-component="paragraph" data-allow-readmode="">Vast profits from the oil pipeline will, in part, go toward achieving that end.</p>
